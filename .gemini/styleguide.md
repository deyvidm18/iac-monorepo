When reviewing code in this repository, please focus on the general logic, structure, and best practices.
Do not provide recommendations for the Terraform configuration files (`.tf`, `.tfvars`), as we are using a recent version that you might not be trained on.
Your feedback should be about the overall design, maintainability, and adherence to the principles outlined in the `GEMINI.md` file.
